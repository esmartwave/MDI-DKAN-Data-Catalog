Field Data Processor

This module adds several plugins to Feeds and leverages the Data module to allow site builders to create a Feed that
parses data from a file field and import it into a database field.

After a user uploads a file, if they have the necessary permission, they will be able to import the data from the file
into a database a unique database table. They will also be able to change the column type for the table using the Data
module.

This is part of the DKAN project (http://drupal.org/projects/dkan). This module will be coupled with a Services plugin
to allow users to upload datasets and have them queried for data visualizations etc.
